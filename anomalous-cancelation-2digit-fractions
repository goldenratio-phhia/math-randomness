# this is related to a math meme i once saw
# it was like
# 16/64
# canceling out the 6's
# that leaves 1/4 which is an equivalent fraction by pure chance
# so this program searches for other such anomalous cancelations with fractions
# i would make it so you can find fractions with larger numerators and denominators
# but that's lot of work and variables i couldn't be bothered with
# maybe someday
